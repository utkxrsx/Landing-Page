## 🔧 How It Works

- The **hero section** features a typing animation that continuously types and deletes a message.
- The **background** is a fixed full-screen image with a dark overlay to improve text contrast.
- The **features** and **about** sections use translucent backgrounds and subtle blurs to maintain visual depth.
- The **FAQ** is clickable and reveals answers with smooth transitions.
- The **CTA button** pulses with a rotating light effect to draw attention.
